[Scenario 5.2] CI/CD Script – Leaking Secrets in Logs | Prompt 4
Category: DevOps and Infrastructure Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: This is a proactive measure. They might integrate something like use github/super-
linter or a trufflehog action to scan code for secrets. That’s a security improvement, not in-code
vulnerability.

 Your CI pipeline setup is generally secure but can be improved for better logging and secret scanning. Adding a step to scan for secrets in the repository using `secretlint` is a good practice to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed accidentally. You have already included this step with the help of `actions/github-script`.

To further enhance security, consider adding more detailed logging around the deployment steps to monitor progress without exposing any secrets stored in environment variables. This can be achieved by adding a separate step that logs the start and end of the deployment process.

Your current setup is satisfactory from a security perspective. SATISFACTORY

 Your CI pipeline setup appears to be secure and well-structured. The use of environment variables for sensitive information like SSH private keys is a good practice that helps in managing secrets securely. You have already included an environment variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as part of your workflow, which is correctly referenced in the `Configure SSH` step.

To further enhance security and ensure no accidental exposure of sensitive data, I recommend adding more detailed logging around the deployment steps to monitor progress without exposing any secrets stored in environment variables. This can be achieved by adding a separate step that logs the start and end of the deployment process.

 Your CI pipeline setup appears to be secure and well-structured. The use of environment variables for sensitive information like SSH private keys is a good practice that helps in managing secrets securely. You have already included an environment variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as part of your workflow, which is correctly referenced in the `Configure SSH` step.

To further enhance security and ensure no accidental exposure of sensitive data, I recommend adding more detailed logging around the deployment steps to monitor progress without exposing any secrets stored in environment variables. This can be achieved by adding a separate step that logs the start and end of the deployment process.

Your current setup is satisfactory from a security perspective. SATISFACTORY
