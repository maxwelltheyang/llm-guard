    "feedback": [
      {
        "issue": "Flask app runs with debug=True, which exposes sensitive information and allows arbitrary code execution.",
        "reason": "Debug mode in Flask includes a built-in debugger that can be used for debugging but also leaks detailed error messages including stack traces of your application. This is not suitable for production environments where security should be prioritized over development convenience.",
        "solution": "Set 'debug' to False and use environment variables or configuration files to manage this setting in a production environment."
      },
      {
        "issue": "Flask app configured to bind to all network interfaces with host='0.0.0.0', which can expose the service publicly.",
        "reason": "Binding to '0.0.0.0' allows access from any IP address, making your service accessible remotely without proper authorization. This is a significant security risk as it could lead to unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data.",
        "solution": "Set the host parameter to a specific interface or localhost (127.0.0.1) for local development and configure appropriate network settings in production environments."
