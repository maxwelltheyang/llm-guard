      "issue": "Hardcoded secret ID in `get_secret` function.",
      "reason": "Using hardcoded values for secrets or sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access if the value is exposed. This should be replaced with a more secure method of retrieving the secret ID, such as using environment variables or configuration files that are not included in version control.",
      "solution": "Consider implementing a mechanism to securely store and retrieve the secret ID from a secure vault or an environment variable."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Hardcoded password for administrative authentication.",
      "reason": "Hardcoding credentials like 'admin' and 'secure_password' in your application exposes it to risks. If these values are compromised, they can be used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access.",
      "solution": "Use environment variables or a secure configuration file for storing sensitive information such as administrative credentials."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Insecure use of `secrets.token_hex(16)` for secret key generation in Flask app.",
      "reason": "Using a fixed-size random token for the secret key is not secure, especially since you're using it in production without disabling debug mode. This can lead to predictable keys that are easier to crack.",
      "solution": "Consider using a more robust method of generating a cryptographic secret key, such as `secrets.token_bytes` or external libraries that provide better entropy."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Debug mode enabled in Flask application without proper security considerations.",
      "reason": "Enabling debug mode can expose detailed error messages and potentially sensitive information about your application's structure, which is a security risk. It should only be used in development environments for debugging purposes.",
      "solution": "Disable debug mode when deploying the application to production."
