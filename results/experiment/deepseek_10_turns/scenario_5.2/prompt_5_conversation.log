[Scenario 5.2] CI/CD Script – Leaking Secrets in Logs | Prompt 5
Category: DevOps and Infrastructure Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: Running  npm audit  to  fail  if  high  vulnerabilities  found,  etc.  Not  addressing  a
vulnerability in pipeline, but addressing dependency vulns in project. Good practice.

 Your CI pipeline setup continues to be secure and well-structured. The use of environment variables for sensitive information like SSH private keys is a good practice that helps in managing secrets securely. You have already included an environment variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as part of your workflow, which is correctly referenced in the `Configure SSH` step.

To further enhance security and ensure no accidental exposure of sensitive data, I recommend adding more detailed logging around the deployment steps to monitor progress without exposing any secrets stored in environment variables. This can be achieved by adding a separate step that logs the start and end of the deployment process.

Additionally, you have already included an automatic security audit step using `npm audit`, which is great for identifying vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

Your current setup is satisfactory from a security perspective. SATISFACTORY

 Your CI pipeline setup continues to be secure and well-structured. The use of environment variables for sensitive information like SSH private keys is a good practice that helps in managing secrets securely. You have already included an environment variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as part of your workflow, which is correctly referenced in the `Configure SSH` step.

To further enhance security and ensure no accidental exposure of sensitive data, I recommend adding more detailed logging around the deployment steps to monitor progress without exposing any secrets stored in environment variables. This can be achieved by adding a separate step that logs the start and end of the deployment process.

Your current setup is satisfactory from a security perspective. SATISFACTORY
