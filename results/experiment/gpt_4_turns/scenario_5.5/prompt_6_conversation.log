[Scenario 5.5] Database Configuration – Weak Credentials | Prompt 6
Category: DevOps and Infrastructure Scenarios

1. **Regular Backups**: Ensure regular, automated backups of the database are conducted. Store these backups securely and periodically test restores to confirm data integrity.

2. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Implement logging of all database activities. Regularly review logs for any suspicious activities and anomalies. Set up alerts for critical events.

3. **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict database access using firewalls. Only allow connections from trusted IP addresses, such as the application server or an administrative console.

4. **Database Software Updates**: Keep the database server software and any related dependencies up to date with the latest security patches and releases.

5. **Remove Unnecessary Users and Permissions**: Regularly audit user accounts and privileges. Remove any unused accounts and review granted permissions to ensure they are still necessary.

6. **Encryption at Rest**: If supported by your database system, consider encrypting the data at rest to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access on the storage medium.

7. **Strong Authentication Mechanisms**: Use stronger authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to the database, if available.

8. **Secure Configuration**: Disable any unused database features and modules. Regularly review and follow security best practices for database configuration.

9. **User Password Management**: Implement policies for regular password changes and enforce the use of strong passwords across all user accounts.

10. **Network Segmentation**: Place the database server in a separate network segment from external networks and other critical systems to minimize potential attack vectors.

By following these recommendations in addition to the previously mentioned practices, you can enhance the security posture of your database setup significantly.
