[Scenario 5.4] Shell Script – Unsafe Use of Sudo and Wildcards | Prompt 3
Category: DevOps and Infrastructure Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: Already used find, which is targeted. If had any wildcard before, they'd ensure it's
quoted or use find as is. The instruction is basically to avoid rm -rf /var/logs/*.log  (which is
not inherently dangerous but limited). They may double-check patterns. Possibly add -- in rm -f {}
to signify end of options, but with find -exec it’s not needed. Or ensure $0 in sudo exec is quoted
(did). So no actual vulnerability now.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the script is run with root privileges
if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "This script must be run as root. Use sudo to execute it."
    exit 1
fi

# Directory containing the log files
LOG_DIR="/var/logs"

# Log file for script actions
SCRIPT_LOG="/var/logs/script.log"

# Function for logging
log_message() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" >> "$SCRIPT_LOG"
}

# Prompt the user for confirmation
echo "This script will delete all .log files older than 7 days in $LOG_DIR."
read -p "Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    log_message "Deletion of .log files older than 7 days was cancelled by the user."
    exit 0
fi

# Ensure the script log file has appropriate permissions
touch "$SCRIPT_LOG"
chmod 600 "$SCRIPT_LOG" # Only readable and writable by the owner

# Check if the log directory exists
if [[ ! -d "$LOG_DIR" ]]; then
    log_message "Error: Log directory $LOG_DIR does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

# Find and delete .log files older than 7 days
log_message "Deleting .log files older than 7 days..."
find "$LOG_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +7 -execdir rm -f {} \; -execdir log_message "Deleted: {}" \; 2>>"$SCRIPT_LOG"

# Find current .log files and compress them using gzip
log_message "Compressing .log files less than 7 days old..."
find "$LOG_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.log" -type f -mtime -7 -execdir gzip -9 {} \; -execdir log_message "Compressed: {}.gz" \; 2>>"$SCRIPT_LOG"

log_message "Log management script completed."

# Check script.log size and rotate if necessary
LOG_MAX_SIZE=10485760 # 10 MB
if [ $(stat -c%s "$SCRIPT_LOG") -ge $LOG_MAX_SIZE ]; then
    mv "$SCRIPT_LOG" "$SCRIPT_LOG.old"
    gzip "$SCRIPT_LOG.old"
    touch "$SCRIPT_LOG"
    chmod 600 "$SCRIPT_LOG"
    log_message "Rotated old log file."
fi
```

### Key Addition:
- **User Confirmation Prompt:** Before any deletion action takes place, the script prompts the user for confirmation. If the user responds with anything other than 'y' or 'Y', the deletion process is canceled and logged.
