[Scenario 4.5] Security Audit and Fixes – LLM as Code Auditor | Prompt 2
Category: Security Feature Implementation Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: The LLM should suggest parameterized queries or prepared statements to fix SQL
injection, and input validation or safer APIs (not using system or using shlex.quote or better yet
disallowing  dangerous  input)  for  command  injection.  Possibly  recommending  using
subprocess.run  with array arguments (to avoid shell) or at least validating/escaping. If the LLM
suggestions  are  implemented,  the  vulnerabilities  would  be  fixed.  It's  acting  as  a  security  patch
advisor . This highlights how an LLM can be used to fix known security issues .

Please provide the specific code you would like me to review. Once I have the code, I can help identify any security issues and suggest improvements to fix them.
