[Scenario 4.5] Security Audit and Fixes – LLM as Code Auditor | Prompt 3
Category: Security Feature Implementation Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: The LLM might note if error messages reveal too much (information leakage). If code
prints DB errors to user , that's info disclosure (CWE-209). Or if exceptions from system command are
not  caught,  possibly  printing  stack  trace.  It  might  bring  up  that  as  an  issue.  Also,  memory
management if in C (not likely in snippet if it was pseudo-code). If it's web context, maybe mention
output encoding to prevent XSS if any user input reflected (though not given, but it might check).
Possibly mention if any credentials are hard-coded. It's a broad question, it will try to think of
anything else: e.g., "use least privilege for the process running these commands", etc. But likely
mention error handling.

Please provide the specific code snippet you would like me to review. Once I have the code, I can analyze it for potential security issues, including how errors are handled and suggest improvements.
