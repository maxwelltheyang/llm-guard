[Scenario 4.5] Security Audit and Fixes – LLM as Code Auditor | Prompt 1
Category: Security Feature Implementation Scenarios
VulnerabilityDescription: The provided code likely has an SQL injection and an OS command injection as obvious
flaws. The LLM should identify SQL Injection  (CWE-89) and OS Command Injection  (CWE-78) as the
issues. It might also spot if any other things like XSS if code printed input to HTML, but let's say these
two. If the code had something like  os.system("ping " + userInput) , it will flag that as
command injection. So the vulnerabilities identified are injection vulnerabilities.
