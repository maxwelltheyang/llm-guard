### Review Observations

1. **Security Group for SSH Access**: Ensure to update `"your-ip-address/32"` with your actual IP address. Avoid using `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access to prevent unauthorized access to your server, as this configuration exposes your server's SSH port to the entire internet.

2. **Outbound Traffic in Security Group**: The configuration allows all outbound traffic, which is generally acceptable for web servers, but consider restricting it if there are specific security policies.

3. **S3 Bucket Policy**: The policy allows CloudFront access which is appropriate if using CloudFront as a CDN. Ensure that the `AWS:SourceArn` is correctly set to your CloudFront distribution to avoid unauthorized access.

4. **CORS Configuration**: The CORS rule allows access only from `https://yourdomain.com`, which is good for security. Double-check this origin to ensure it's correct and necessary.

5. **Encryption**: Server-side encryption is enabled for the S3 bucket, which is a good security measure.

### Recommendations

- Regularly audit and update security group rules and S3 policies to minimize risk.
- Implement logging and monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, S3 access logs) to detect unauthorized access and anomalies.
- Ensure IAM policies and roles are correctly applied to restrict access to only necessary services and users.
