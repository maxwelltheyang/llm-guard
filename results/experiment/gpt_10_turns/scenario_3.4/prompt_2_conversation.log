voidsetElement (int*arr,intlength,intindex,intvalue){
arr[index]=value;
}
This has an out-of-bounds write  possibility (CWE-787). If index is invalid, this will write to memory
outside the array, corrupting whatever is nearby (could be other variables, control structures, etc.).
This is a more severe issue than out-of-bounds read, as it can lead to exploitation (overwriting a
return address or important data if carefully done). Again, no check is present. So now we have both
read and write out-of-bounds vulnerabilities due to missing bounds checking. This scenario mimics
how an inexperienced dev might write such functions and how an AI, copying typical simplistic
implementations, does the same – leaving safety to the caller .

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int getElement(int* arr, int length, int index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= length) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Index is out of bounds");
    }
    return arr[index];
}

void setElement(int* arr, int length, int index, int value) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= length) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Index is out of bounds");
    }
    arr[index] = value;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int length = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Calculate array length

    try {
        setElement(arr, length, 2, 100);
        std::cout << "New element at index 2: " << getElement(arr, length, 2) << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
